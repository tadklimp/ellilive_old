## ElliLive
### - Currently under construction -  

## Description

This a set of SuperCollider Classes I use while performing live as _Tadklimp_ or with our _Ellicist_ duo.  
There are currently "hard-coded" directories and still under development.  
I use the Monome 128 as a matrix placeholder to keep chunks of code in numerous buttons that can be stored or triggered in real-time. Sequential control is currently minimally supported.

A performance with these tools can be seen here: [link][link] 

At the moment I'm experimenting with an alternative TidalCycles method which, when ready, will replace the current Classes.
An introduction to that can be found here:[link][tuto] 

Built with the [Grr-sc][grr] SC extension.
